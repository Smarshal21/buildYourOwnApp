# ZenMode  

## About the App  
ZenMode is an Android application that allows users to schedule silent mode activation for specific times, ensuring they never get caught off guard in meetings, classes, or any important events. Instead of manually toggling silent mode, users can automate it based on their schedule.  

## How Itâ€™s Built  
- **Tech Stack:** Android (Kotlin, XML)  
- **Architecture:** Clean architecture with Data, Domain, and Presentation layers  
- **Dependency Injection:** Koin  
- **Asynchronous Processing:** Kotlin Coroutines  
- **Local Storage:** Room Database for persisting schedules  

## Limitations  
- Currently supports only predefined schedules and does not integrate with external calendars.  

## Next Milestone  
- Add calendar integration for automatic schedule detection.  
- Enhance UI/UX for a more intuitive user experience.
